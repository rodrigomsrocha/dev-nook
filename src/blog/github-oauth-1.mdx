## Whats OAuth 2.0 and how does it works?
OAuth 2.0 (Open Authorization) is an authorization strategy that enables third-party
applications to access some resources on behalf of a user without needing to know
the user's credentials (such as username and passwords). It provides a more secure
way for users to grant access to other applications without sharing sensitive information.

The OAuth 2.0 protocol is used by modern web applicaitons to allow users to log in
using their existing accounts from populars services like Google, Facebook, Twitter,
GitHub, and others.

### But why OAtuh?
We have a lot of strategies to implement authorization, but OAtuh is special in
three ways:

- **Granular Access Levels:** That means that when the user logs in with some of
the services mentioned before, you can request specific information from their
account. For example, if you only need their profile name and email for your app,
you can request that data. This allows apps to request only the data they need.
- **Read or Read + Write Access:** You can either ask them just to retrieve
information like name, email, etc. Or you can ask for write access as well. For
example you have a blog app that wants to post to Facebook's user account, then
we would need an Read + Write Access.
- **Revoke Access:** The service we're using to authenticate our users must give
them the ability to revoke access at any time. For example, if we're authenticating
with GitHub, the user should be able to go into their accout and de-authorize the
access they granted to our website

## Implementing GitHub OAuth
Now let's put hands on work and build a small application using the OAuth strategy.

### The OAuth flow
1. The client requests authorization from the resource owner (user) by redirecting
them to the authorization server.
2. The user authenticates with the authorization server and grants permission to
the client.
3. The authorization server issues an access token to the client.
4. The client uses the access token to request resources from the resource server
on behalf of the user.
5. The resource server validates the access token and, if valid, provides the
requested resources to the client.

### Creating a Next app
First let's start by creating an application in NextJS:

```bash
npm create next-app oauth2.0
```

Mark yes for everything we will use the app router and next 13 features.

Let's create some components, create a components folder at src, then create a
**Profile.tsx** it'll look like this:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export function Profile() {
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-2 items-center bg-zinc-700 p-2 rounded w-60">
      <Image
        src="https://github.com/rodrigomsrocha.png"
        width={60}
        height={60}
        alt="rodrigo"
        className="rounded"
      />
      <p>
        Rodrigo
        <a
          className="block text-red-400 transition-colors hover:text-red-500"
          href="#"
        >
          Log out
        </a>
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And the **Signin.tsx** component:

```tsx
import { LuGithub } from 'react-icons/lu'

export function SignIn() {
  return (
    <div>
      <a
        className="bg-zinc-500 text-lg py-2 px-4 rounded flex gap-2 items-center transition-colors hover:bg-zinc-600"
        href="#"
      >
        <LuGithub className="text-2xl" />
        Login with GitHub
      </a>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the home page (page.tsx) file, we will conditionally render the components above:

```tsx
import { Profile } from '@/components/Profile'
import { SignIn } from '@/components/Signin'

export default function Home() {
  const isAuthenticated = false
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      {isAuthenticated ? <Profile /> : <SignIn />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

We will change it later. Continue in [part 2](/github-oauth-2)
