In the [last part](/github-oauth-1) we created a simple app to use the OAuth
authorization strategy, now we will continue, and finish our app.

## Setting up GitHub
Firstly we need to create an OAuth app at our GitHub account, you can do this by
going, Settings > Developer settings > OAtuh apps > **New OAuth App**, you will
see something like this:

<img className="rounded" src="/new-oauth-app.png" />

You can fill like the image, but adapt to your application, and you need to change
it later when you deploy.

After that you need to save to environment variables, the client id and the client secret,
take a look:

<img className="rounded" src="/variables.png" />

Copy the client id then generate a new client secret and copy it too, save it to
your environment variables.

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = "client id"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = "client secret"
```

The client id will be used both in client side and server side that's why is public,
in the other hand, our client secret will be only used in server side, so it doesn't
need to be public.

## Authorization flow

The authorization flow will look like this:

1. Our app makes a request, GitHub redirects to the URL callback with the code as
a URL parameter.
2. Then we exchange this code for an access_token passing the code as an URL
parameter.
3. Finally we use the access_token as an header Authorization parameter to get
user information on their behalf.

<img className="rounded" src="/flow.png" />

Let's code this.

### 1. Get the code

In our SignIn component, we will change the anchor's href to the following URL,
passing the client id as a parameter.

```tsx
export function SignIn() {
  return (
    <div>
      <a
        // ...
        href={`https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}`}
      >
      </a>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We will be redirect to the callback URL we set, it will be an api route in our
application, to reach this in Next create a file following the structure above.

```md
app
â””â”€â”€ api
    â””â”€â”€ auth
        â””â”€â”€ callback
            â””â”€â”€ route.ts
```

Inside the file we can get the code from the URL params.

```ts
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // get code
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)

  const code = searchParams.get('code')
}
```

### 2. Get the access token

Now we need to exchange the code we got for an access token, that will allow us
to get user information. To do this we need to make a POST request passing the
code, the client id, and client secret as URL params.

```ts
import axios from 'axios'
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // ...

  const accessTokenResponse = await axios.post(
    'https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token',
    null,
    {
      params: {
        code,
        client_id: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
      },
      headers: {
        Accept: 'application/json',
      },
    },
  )

  const { access_token } = accessTokenResponse.data
}
```

Notice that we pass this header Accept option, so we can recieve the response in
JSON.

### 3. Handle user information

Now with the access token, we can make a request to the GitHub api on behalf of
the user, to get the info we need. After that we will save this data into a jwt.

```ts
import axios from 'axios'
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // ...

  const userResponse = await axios.get('https://api.github.com/user', {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    },
  })

  const userInfo = userResponse.data

  // handle user info

  const token = jwt.sign(
    {
      name: userInfo.name,
      avatarUrl: userInfo.avatar_url,
    },
    'shhhhh', // change this to a more secure secret
    {
      expiresIn: '30 days',
    },
  )
}
```

With everything done, we can redirect the user back to our home page, and save
the jwt as a cookie, so we can get their information later.

```ts
import axios from 'axios'
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // ...

  const tokenExpiresInSeconds = 60 * 60 * 24 * 30
  const redirectUrl = new URL('/', request.url)

  return NextResponse.redirect(redirectUrl, {
    headers: {
      'Set-Cookie': `token=${token}; Path=/; max-age=${tokenExpiresInSeconds}`,
    },
  })
}
```

The Set-Cookie header will set a token, available in all of our app with the same
max-age our token has.

## Using our user data

Our user is authorized and inside the token we have its information, now let's
use it.

Firstly, we will render the Profile component, checking if we have a token
inside our cookies.

```tsx
import { Profile } from '@/components/Profile'
import { SignIn } from '@/components/Signin'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'

export default function Home() {
  const isAuthenticated = cookies().has('token')

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      {isAuthenticated ? <Profile /> : <SignIn />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Create a folder called lib inside our src directory, inside that folder we will
put files that can be helpful for our application. We will create the auth.ts lib.

```ts
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'

interface User {
  name: string
  avatarUrl: string
}

export function getUser() {
  const token = cookies().get('token')?.value

  if (!token) {
    throw new Error('Unauthenticated')
  }

  const user = jwt.verify(token, 'shhhhh')
  // handle if the token is invalid

  return user as User
}
```

Going to our Profile component. let's render the user information.

```tsx
import { getUser } from '@/app/lib/auth'
import Image from 'next/image'

export function Profile() {
  const user = getUser()

  return (
    <div className="flex gap-2 items-center bg-zinc-700 p-2 rounded w-60">
      <Image
        src={user.avatarUrl}
        width={60}
        height={60}
        alt={user.name}
        className="rounded"
      />
      <p>
        {user.name}
        <a
          className="block text-red-400 transition-colors hover:text-red-500"
          href="#"
        >
          Log out
        </a>
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Logout route

Lastly we need to make possible for the user to log out, we just need to remove
the token cookie, and we can make this using another api route. Follow the structure
above

```md
app
â””â”€â”€ api
    â””â”€â”€ auth
        â”œâ”€â”€ callback
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ route.ts
        â””â”€â”€ logout
            â””â”€â”€ route.ts
```

Inside the file we can remove the cookie with the Set-Cookie header option.

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const redirectURL = new URL('/', request.url)

  return NextResponse.redirect(redirectURL, {
    headers: {
      'Set-Cookie': `token=; Path=/; max-age=0;`,
    },
  })
}
```

In our Profile component, we redirect the user to this route using the anchor.

```tsx
export function Profile() {
  // ...
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-2 items-center bg-zinc-700 p-2 rounded w-60">
      ...
        <a
          className="block text-red-400 transition-colors hover:text-red-500"
          href="/api/auth/logout"
        >
          Log out
        </a>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

Aaaand we're done.

## Conclusion
This is a tutorial using the GitHub OAuth strategy, but this apply to most of the
services we have. I hope you found it helpful, sign in With Google, Facebook and
GitHub is a simply way to allow users to sign in to their account without having
to fill additional login details. If you have any trouble you can check the source
code in this [repo](https://github.com/rodrigomsrocha/oauth2.0), and the
[GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps).
Happy coding bye bye ðŸ‘‹.
